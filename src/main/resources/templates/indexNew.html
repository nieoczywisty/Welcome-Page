            <p>Hi. I'm mechanical engineer and computer science enthusiast.
                After completing my engineering studies and working for few years I've decided to change my career path and started postgraduate studies in programming field.
                I'm looking for internship programme </p>

            <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
                Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
                when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
                It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
                remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
                containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
                including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

                    <p>This project gathers all my knowledge so far. In the back-end I've created spring boot app that handles http requests, calls external Rest API found on
                        <a href="https://dane.gov.pl/"> https://dane.gov.pl/</a> and collects data in JSON format.
                        Using unmarshalling I've crated POJO classes corresponding to data recieved from API.
                        Collected data contains information such as: GPS positions, signal quality, number of the vehicle etc.
                        from public transportation company in GdaÅ„sk. Then I wanted to present this data somehow, so I've added Leaflet map with marked positions of all vehicles.
                        You can click on any marker and see what line is it. After pressing the button below a new iFrame is created and loaded with map populated with collected data and new
                        table is created, all using some javascript. The table contains basic info of first 10 vehicles from the list. I"ve done a little cheat here because I cannot access model attributes directly
                        from javascript. The Json string is first loaded into hidden element and then accessed in javascript as variable.
